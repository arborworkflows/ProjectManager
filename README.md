ProjectManager
==============

Application prototype to upload datasets into Arbor, create new projects, and organize source data.

This application is originally developed using Python and PyQt technology. It allows users to create 
projects in Arbor, upload source data (phylogentic trees, character matrices, occurrence 
data, etc.) into the Arbor database, and prepare for analysis. 

This application provides a more friendly front-end to uploading data instead of requiring custom scripts to upload data into the server component of Arbor.   This app exercises a python file and project management API that will be a common way to access data stored in Arbor from either thick or thin clients.
